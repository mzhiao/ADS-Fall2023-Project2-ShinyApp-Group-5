# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **OpenFEMA** of your choice using openFema Dataset released [here](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets). This app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how disater were distributed across years and locations and demonstrate other disater-relevant measures. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The raw data will be stored as a zip in the "data" subfolder because one of the raw csv file is too big to be uploaded to github.

+ **Project summary**: In this project, we used openFema data on disaster declaration summaries and web declaration areas to visualize the quantity and frequency of various disaters across different states and different time. We focused on creating a year trend plot, 2 interactive plots about location and incident types, and a final map.
