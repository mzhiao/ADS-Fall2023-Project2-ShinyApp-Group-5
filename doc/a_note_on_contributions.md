### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project 2 - Team 5 

Team members: Nashita Rahman, Clarence Jiang, Miao Zhang, Yihan Zhang

Summary: In this project, we used openFema data on disaster declaration summaries and web declaration areas to visualize the quantity and frequency of various disaters across different states and different time. We focused on creating a year trend plot, 2 interactive plots about location and incident types, and a final map.


[Contribution Statement]:

We both decided the topic and study.

Nashita created an interactive map tab that displays a heatmap of the FEMA disaster declarations. The maps can be filtered by year range and incident type. Nashita used county and state information to generate latitude and longitude information for disaster declarations, which is the preprocessing step.

Miao created the interactive plot of the location plot. The plot can filter by year range of 10 years and disaster type and shows the disaster count of different states.

Yihan created the interactive plot of the incident type plot. The plot can filter by date and shows the count of different disastesr in the date range. 

Clarence created the year trend plot. It shows 3 different disaster-features which can be selected by the user and demonstrates how the distribution of these features change over time. Clarence published the shiny app and helped merge the branches and git version control.

All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
